ref: _update-additional-info

  If no document matches the update condition, the default behavior of
  the update method is to do nothing. By specifying the ``upsert``
  option to true, the update operation either updates matching
  document(s) or inserts a new document if no matching document exists.
  In the {{driver}}, see {{update}}. 

  In MongoDB, write operations are atomic on the level of a single
  document. If a single update operation modifies multiple documents of
  a collection, the operation can interleave with other write
  operations on that collection. In the MongoDB Manual, see
  :manual:`Atomicity </core/write-operations-atomicity>`. 

  For all available update operators, see the :manual:`Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update>` reference page in the MongoDB Manual.
