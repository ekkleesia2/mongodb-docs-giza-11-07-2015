ref: _update-replace-overview
content: |
   To replace the **entire** document except for the ``_id`` field, pass
   an entirely new document as the second argument to the
   {{update}} method. The replacement document can have
   different fields from the original document. In the replacement
   document, you can omit the ``_id`` field since the ``_id`` field is
   immutable. If you do include the ``_id`` field, it must be the same
   value as the existing value.

   .. important::
      After the update, the document **only** contains the field or
      fields in the replacement document.
