ref: _query-overview
pre: |
   You can use the {{find}} method to issue a query to retrieve data from a
   collection in MongoDB. All queries in MongoDB have the scope of a
   single collection.
content: |
   Queries can return all documents in a collection or only the
   documents that match a specified filter or criteria. You can specify
   the filter or criteria in a {{document}} and pass as a parameter to the
   {{find}} method.

   The {{find}} method returns query results in a {{cursor}}, which is
   an iterable object that yields documents.

ref: _query-operators-overview
pre: |
   MongoDB provides operators to specify query conditions, such as
   :manual:`comparison operators </reference/operators/query-comparison>`.
   Although there are some exceptions, such as the :query:`$or` and
   :query:`$and` conditional operators, query conditions using operators
   generally have the following form:

content: |
   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field1>: { <operator1>: <value1> } }

   For a complete list of the operators, see :manual:`query operators
   </reference/operator/query>`.
