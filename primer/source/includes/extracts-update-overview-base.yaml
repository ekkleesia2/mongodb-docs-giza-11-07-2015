   You can use the {{update}} method to update
   documents of a collection. The method accepts as its parameters:
content: |
   - a filter document to match the documents to update,

   - an update document to specify the modification to perform, and

   - an options parameter (optional).

   To specify the filter, use the same structure and syntax as
   the query conditions. See :doc:`/query` for an introduction to query
   conditions.

   By default, the {{update}} method
   updates a single document. Use the ``multi`` option to update all
   documents that match the criteria.

   You cannot update the ``_id`` field.
