======================================
Replica Sets with Four or More Members
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Although the standard replica set configuration has three members, you
can deploy larger sets. Add additional members to a set to increase
redundancy or to add capacity for distributing secondary read
operations.

Considerations
--------------

As you add new members to a replica set, consider the following:

Odd Number of Voting Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that the replica set has an odd number of voting members. If you
have an *even* number of voting members, deploy an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>` so that the set has an odd number.

For example, the following replica set includes an arbiter to ensure an
odd number of voting members.

Maximum Number of Voting Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replica set can have up to 
:limit:`50 members <Number of Members of a Replica Set>`, but only 
:limit:`7 voting members <Number of Voting Members of a Replica Set>`.
[#master-slave]_ If the replica set already has 7
voting members, additional members must be :ref:`non-voting members
<replica-set-non-voting-members>`.

For example, the following 9 member replica set has 7 voting members
and 2 non-voting members.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-only-seven-voting-members.rst

See :ref:`replica-set-non-voting-members` for more information.

Location of the Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A majority of the replica set's members should be in your application's
main data center.

For example, the following 5 member replica set has the majority, 3, of
its members in its main data center, ``Data Center 1``.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-three-data-centers.rst

Electability of Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some members of the replica set, such as members that have networking
restraint or limited resources, should not be able to become primary in
a :term:`failover`. Configure members that should not become primary to
have :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`. 

For example, the secondary member in the third data center with a
priority of 0 cannot become primary:
