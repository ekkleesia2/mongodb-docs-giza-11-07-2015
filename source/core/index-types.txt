MongoDB provides a number of different index types. You can create
indexes on any field or embedded field within a document or
embedded document.

In general, you should create indexes that support your common and
user-facing queries. Having these indexes will ensure that MongoDB
scans the smallest possible number of documents.

In the :program:`mongo` shell, you can create an index by calling the
:method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` method. For
more detailed instructions about building indexes, see the
:doc:`Indexing Tutorials </administration/indexes>` page.
