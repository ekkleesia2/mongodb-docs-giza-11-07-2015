============================================
Backup a Sharded Cluster with Database Dumps
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a sharded cluster. This procedure
uses :program:`mongodump` to create dumps of the :program:`mongod`
instance. An alternate procedure uses file system snapshots to capture
the backup data, and may be more efficient in some situations if your
system configuration allows file system backups. See
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for more
information.

See :doc:`/core/backups` and
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for complete
information on backups in MongoDB and backups of sharded clusters
in particular.

Consideration
-------------

To create these backups of a sharded cluster, you will stop the
cluster balancer and take a backup of the :term:`config database`,
and then take backups of each shard in the cluster using
:program:`mongodump` to capture the backup data. To capture a more
exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all
application writes before taking the filesystem snapshots; otherwise
the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, taking the backup from a
single offline secondary member of the replica set that provides each
shard can improve the quality of the backup while minimizing impact on
the cluster.
