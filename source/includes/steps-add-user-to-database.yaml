  To authenticate the ``reportsUser``, you must authenticate the user
  in the ``reporting`` database; i.e. specify
  :option:`--authenticationDatabase reporting <mongo --authenticationDatabase>`.

  You can create a user without assigning roles, choosing instead to assign the
  roles later. To do so, create the user with an empty
  :data:`~admin.system.users.roles` array.
